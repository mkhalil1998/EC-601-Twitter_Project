Phase 1: Exploring the twitter API
--------

TwitterProject-Phase1.py allows the user to extract the most recent twitter posts for a particular user. 
The code also cleans the data so that it is ready for the next step of NLP. 

Testing: The code was tested with extracting the most recent twitter posts from Cristiano Ronaldo and they were compared to the tweets on twitter.
